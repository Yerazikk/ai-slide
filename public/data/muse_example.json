      "text": "Problem: Notes are Thought Graves\nInspiration doesn’t wait.\nHumans have ~6,200 thoughts/day, many when we’re unprepared to record.\n72% report having ephemeral ideas (i.e., “shower thoughts”).\n<2% of thoughts are captured in any form (notes, Google/ChatGPT queries, etc.).\nRecorded ideas simply wither.\nNotes are rarely revisited; ~1% of saved content is used later.\nReviewing old notes is like “sifting through stale garbage.”\nImportant insights end up buried in unorganized heaps, never to be seen or used again.\nProductivity costs: the time tax.\nThe average employee wastes ~1.8 hrs per workday looking for info they’ve already seen.\nAs much as 50% of the workweek can be spent re-finding notes/files.\nThe Cost: ~$3,900 per employee per year. (lost time, duplicated work, missed opportunities)",
